# Go Functions Showcase

This Go program demonstrates several functions created by different contributors. Each function performs a specific task and is tested independently.

// 1. Write a Go program that determines whether a given integer is even or odd. 

The program should include a function called isEven that takes an integer parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the number is even or not.
In the main function, a variable is define (num) with a value of 7, then use the isEven function to determine if num is even or odd, and print the result accordingly.
